## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, sophisticated blue (#5A7D9A), evoking trust and stability without being overly corporate. This color helps to make the user feel safe when submitting important information.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that enhances readability and reduces eye strain.  The value is only 20% saturation, providing only a slight contrast to the overall page, but a calming sense of spaciousness.
- Accent color: A warm, contrasting orange (#E08E49) for key CTAs and interactive elements, drawing attention to important actions without disrupting the overall aesthetic.  The hue is approximately 30 degrees 'left' of the primary.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used for all headings and body text because of its modern, objective and neutral look.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different sections of the form and provide visual cues to the user.
- Implement a clear and intuitive layout with well-defined sections and ample spacing, guiding the user through the registration process in a logical manner.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience, without being distracting.
